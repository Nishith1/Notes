ðŸŸ¡ Peer Feedback for Zarina â€” Elaborated & Natural
1. How does this colleague deliver the goals of our team, business/function and the company?

From my perspective as a peer, Zarina has shown strong ownership by taking on the Universal Data Comparator (UDC) â€” which is a flagship project for our team. Sheâ€™s confident, vocal in meetings, and makes sure her perspective is clearly heard. She has also been proactive in driving the work on this initiative from the start, which shows her intent to contribute meaningfully.

At the same time, her approach has been quite individual-driven. A lot of design discussions, planning, and development decisions happened in silos, and as a result, the rest of the team often didnâ€™t have full visibility into what was going on. This made it difficult for others to stay aligned or provide input at the right time. For a project with such high visibility across the organization, involving the team more early on could have really helped â€” both in terms of design quality and delivery speed. A more collaborative approach would have allowed us to pool our expertise and reduce some of the delays we faced.

2. How does this colleague identify and deliver appropriate solutions that address the needs of clients/customers/stakeholders?

Zarina understands that UDC is a critical piece of work with multiple stakeholders across teams depending on it. She stepped up to lead the solutioning for it, which shows her willingness to take responsibility.

However, the way the solutioning was approached felt quite closed. She mostly relied on her own understanding and decisions instead of using the teamâ€™s collective expertise. Many of us in the team have hands-on experience with tools like Spark, Kafka, GKP, S3, Cockroach DB, and event-based patterns. There were plenty of opportunities where she couldâ€™ve reached out, asked for input, or even just bounced ideas â€” which would have made the solution more robust and saved a lot of time. Because this didnâ€™t happen, the alignment with product and architecture took longer, and some of the technical priorities didnâ€™t match stakeholder expectations. A more consultative and open style would have helped get better solutions faster.

3. How does this colleague drive a robust risk & controls environment?

Because Zarina worked mostly on her own for a long time, the rest of us didnâ€™t always have a clear view of how the design was shaping up or what the key risks were. A lot of potential issues surfaced quite late in the cycle, which forced multiple rounds of meetings, reviews, and realignments to address them.

Another factor that added to the risk was her lack of clarity around some of the frameworks and tools used in the project. For example, there were times when she seemed unsure about how certain components fit into the overall architecture. If these uncertainties had been discussed earlier with the team, we could have easily supported her and avoided unnecessary delays. Regular updates, open design reviews, and early flagging of blockers would have made the risk management much smoother.

4. How does this colleague foster a collaborative and inclusive environment that supports growth and development?

Zarina is very vocal and assertive in discussions, which can be a strength, but Iâ€™ve often seen that she doesnâ€™t always give space for others to speak or contribute. There have been multiple situations where sheâ€™s cut people off mid-sentence or dismissed inputs too quickly, which can discourage open conversations.

She also tends to stay fairly isolated from team discussions outside her work. She rarely joins in broader team interactions or knowledge-sharing discussions, which leads to her missing important context on team decisions. Over time, this has made it harder for others to approach her with ideas or support, because the engagement just isnâ€™t there.

If she can work on listening more actively, being open to different viewpoints, and participating in team conversations more regularly, I think it would really strengthen the overall team dynamic. It would also build more trust and make collaboration a lot smoother.

âœ… Summary:
Zarina is a confident and vocal engineer who has taken ownership of a critical project. However, her very individual style of working and limited collaboration have created some gaps in visibility, technical alignment, and team dynamics. With her level of experience, if she becomes more open to involving others, actively listening, and sharing progress transparently, she can make a much bigger impact â€” not just on the project but on the team as a whole.
